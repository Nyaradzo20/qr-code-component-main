## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- css

### What I learned

I have learnt how to center text using text align:
"
.text{

 justify-content: center;
 text-align: center;
}
"
I actually spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to male space pn the end sides of the text.
I have used height:auto; for the first time.



```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>

```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
  .text{

 justify-content: center;
 text-align: center;
}
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
